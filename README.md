# BachelorthesisSourcecode
The Sourcecode of my bachelor's thesis
In the benchmark folder is the exact code I used to get the measurments in my Bachelor's thesis
In the other folders is the normal version without the bash script.
The python code transforms the output into a .vts file to look at the result e.g. in ParaView
